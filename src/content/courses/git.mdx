title: Git
description: Git is a distributed version-control system that records your project history as a content-addressable graph of snapshots, letting you commit, inspect, and revert changes locally. It differs by using lightweight branch pointers, a staging area for composing commits, and cryptographic hashes for integrity, which makes branching/merging fast and most operations work offline.
