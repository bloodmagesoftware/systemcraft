title: JIT
description: A just-in-time (JIT) compiler translates parts of a programâ€™s source code into native machine code while the program runs. By compiling hot (frequently executed) paths using runtime information, it delivers near-compiled performance while keeping the flexibility of interpretation. It is a combination of an interpreter and a compiler.
