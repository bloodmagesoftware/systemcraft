title: Container
description: A container (e.g., Docker) packages an application with its libraries and runtime into a lightweight, isolated user-space environment that runs on the host OS kernel. It shares the host kernel (unlike a VM), so containers start fast and use resources more efficiently, making apps portable across environments.
