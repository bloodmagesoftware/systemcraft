title: Stack
description: The stack is a region of a process's memory that stores function call frames in LIFO order—local variables, return addresses, and saved registers—so nested calls can allocate and free short-lived data automatically. It’s managed by the CPU/runtime (via the stack pointer) for fast, predictable allocation but has limited size and lifetime.
