title: Virtual Machine
description: A virtual machine (VM) is software that emulates a complete computer (virtual hardware) so you can run an operating system and applications as if on a real machine. It isolates workloads and lets multiple OS instances share the same physical host while the hypervisor manages CPU, memory, storage and networking.
