title: Heap
description: The heap is a region of a process’s memory used for dynamic allocation at runtime (via APIs like malloc/new or language-managed allocators). It provides space for variable-sized or longer-lived objects whose lifetimes aren’t tied to function call stack frames, managed by an allocator or garbage collector.
