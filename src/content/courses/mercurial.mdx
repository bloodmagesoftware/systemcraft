title: Mercurial
description: Mercurial is a distributed version-control system that records project history as immutable changesets and provides fast, atomic local operations across platforms. It emphasizes a small, consistent command set, a clear, human-readable data model with named branches and bookmarks, and built-in extension points so branching, merging and common workflows behave predictably and are easy to script.
