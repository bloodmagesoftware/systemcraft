title: Perforce Helix Core
description: Perforce Helix Core is a high‑performance, server‑based version control system that stores and serves file history, large binary assets, and metadata for very large codebases and user teams. It differs by using a centralized atomic changelist model with per-file locking, a global namespace and stream-based branching, plus optimized storage, proxying and replication to scale for huge monorepos and binary-heavy workflows.
