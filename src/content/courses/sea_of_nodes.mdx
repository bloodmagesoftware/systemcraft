title: Sea of Nodes
description: A sea-of-nodes compiler represents the program as one unified graph where each node is an operation and edges encode both data and control dependencies, replacing separate syntax and control-flow structures. That whole-program graph lets the compiler perform global optimizations, instruction scheduling, and speculative transformations by reasoning about dependencies across the entire program.
