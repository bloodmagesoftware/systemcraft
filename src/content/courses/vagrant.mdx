title: Vagrant
description: Vagrant is a command-line tool that automates creating, configuring, and managing reproducible development environments (VMs or containers) from a simple configuration file. It abstracts the underlying provider (VirtualBox, VMware, Docker, etc.) and integrates provisioning so teams can share identical setups.
