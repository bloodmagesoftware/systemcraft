description: Docker Swarm is Docker’s built-in container orchestration tool that groups multiple Docker hosts into a single cluster and treats them as one virtual Docker engine. It schedules and distributes containers across the cluster and provides service discovery, load balancing, scaling, and desired‑state reconciliation.
